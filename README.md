# IoT-Assessment-Smart_Home_Dataset_with-_Weather-_Information
A smart home refers to a dwelling that utilizes internet-connected devices to facilitate remote supervision and regulation of appliances and systems, such as heating,lighting and consumption and generation of energy. This technology, offers homeowners various benefits, including energy efficiency, monitoring of energy consumtion of IoT devices in home and predicting its usage in future based on the weather conditions.

For this, we have used dataset with all reading of multiple IoT devices in home from sensors and used ARIMA model to predict the comsumtion in future.
